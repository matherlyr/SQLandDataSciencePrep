      <li>The keyword INNER JOIN uses two tables that have a column in common to combine the two tables. For example, if
          a table called Fruits had columns named FruitName and FruitID and another table called FruitInfo had columns named
          FruitID and Price, then in SQL a user would need INNER JOIN to be able to see the fruit names and the prices of
          each fruit. The code would look like the following: <br>
          <br>SELECT Fruits.FruitName, FruitInfo.Price
          <br>FROM Fruits
          <br>INNER JOIN FruitInfo ON Fruits.FruitID = FruitInfo.FruitID</li>
       <br>
      <li>A data sciencetist is someone who likes to work with data, manipulate data, find out how to display data in new 
          and interesting ways, and discover trends about the data. </li>
