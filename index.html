  <h1> SQL and Data Science Prep</h1>
  <br>
  <ol>
      <li>The keyword INNER JOIN uses two tables that have a column in common to combine the two tables. For example, if
          a table called Fruits had columns named FruitName and FruitID and another table called FruitInfo had columns named
          FruitID and Price, then in SQL a user would need INNER JOIN to be able to see the fruit names and the prices of
          each fruit on a table together. The code would look like the following: <br>
          <br>SELECT Fruits.FruitName, FruitInfo.Price
          <br>FROM Fruits
          <br>INNER JOIN FruitInfo ON Fruits.FruitID = FruitInfo.FruitID</li>
       <br>
      <li>A data scientist is someone who works with data, manipulates data, finds out how to display data in new 
          and interesting ways, and discovers trends about the data. A data scientist uses alogrithims to look for meaning 
          within the all data collected. Although around 70% of the time is spent prepping the data and collecting the data,
          data scientists use thier knowledge of alogorithims to help find useful information and hopefully help clients make
          better business decisions by creating visualiztions and models to represent their findings. For example, data scientists helped Netflix find a better alogorithim for reccomending
          shows to users. This is similar and different to a computer scientist. While computer scientists also use alogorithims, 
          computer scientists develop the alogrithims that computers can use, and data scientists use the alogithims to find
          out information about the data.</li>
